# Machine-Learning

I recently got into Machine Learning. After finishing the excellent Coursera course by Prof. Nguyen from  Standford University, I am hunting for projects to practice and improve my gathered skills.

I believe I'll use datasets from Kaggle to build models. This project is open for collaboration.
